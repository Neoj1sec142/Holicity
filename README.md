## Future Updates:
* I ran into a bunch of issues with the messenger so my first future update will be to get that running properly and figure out how to run that within the site from the same server if possible.
* Also I would like to style the page better because I am definitely not a CSS master
* I have a section of post and blog that allows users to share suggestions about what theyd like to see on the page, as the most loyal customers and supporters may come from people who feel theyve been heard and see theyre ideas implemented in the site they made suggestions too.
